What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge combines two branches of a git repo, perserving their history as 2 separate branches.
Meanwhile, a rebase effectively removes the dual branch structure by imposing the changes of one branch onto another. This
creates more of a linear history.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is one held on a remote server such as Github or Gitlab.
You must use push and pull/fetch to transfer to and from the remote repository.
